# 2019_code

A repo with information on everyone's git commits during 2019

## Steps

1. Clone this repo. Preferably, clone it to the common folder where you keep all your other repos. For example, I keep all my stuff under `~/Documents/GitHub/...`

2. Open the `get_my_commits.R` file

3. Modify the username variable (Line X)

4. Source the script (or "run all", whichever you prefer)

5. Commit and push your history of commits

6. Done, thanks!
