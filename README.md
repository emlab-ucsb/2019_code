# 2019_code

A repo with information on everyone's git commits during 2019

## Steps

1. Clone this repo. Preferably, clone it to the common folder where you keep all your other repos. For example, I keep all my stuff under `~/Documents/GitHub/...`

2. Open the `get_my_commits.R` file

3. Modify the `path` and `user` variable (Lines 7 and 8)

4. Source the script (or "run all", or "line-by-line"... whichever you prefer)

5. Commit and push your history of commits! (you should see a csv file created under your name

6. Done, thanks!

## Advanced
 If for some reason you keep repos in many different places, you would have to manually run the `get_commits` function on each meta-directory.
