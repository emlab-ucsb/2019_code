# 2019_code

A repo with information on everyone's git commits during 2019

## Steps

1. Clone this repo. Preferably, clone it to the common folder where you keep all your other repos. For example, I keep all my stuff under `~/Documents/GitHub/...`

2. Open the `get_my_commits.R` file

3. Modify the `path` and `user` variable (Lines 7 and 8)*

4. Source the script (or "run all", or "line-by-line"... whichever you prefer)

5. Commit and push your history of commits! (you should see a csv file created under your name

6. Done, thanks!

## Advanced
 If for some reason you keep repos in many different places, you would have to manually run the `get_commits` function on each meta-directory.

*Note: As Ian pointed it out, you may have to use your name (or what GitHub thinks your name is) instead. For example, iladner won't work because Ian has it set up as Ian Ladner. Tru both...
